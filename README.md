# PolicyNet: Openpilot-Compatible Policy Training

A reinforcement learning system for training autonomous driving policies that are **seamless drop-in replacements** for the existing openpilot policy model.

## 🎯 Project Goal

Train a policy network from scratch that:
- ✅ **Outperforms** the stock openpilot policy on lane centering, safety, and comfort
- ✅ **Seamlessly integrates** with existing openpilot vision model and control stack  
- ✅ **Drops in** as an ONNX replacement with identical input/output interface
- ✅ **Generalizes** across diverse driving scenarios through domain randomization

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
uv sync

# 2. Train a policy (starts immediately, no curriculum)
python run_training.py --env dummy --episodes 50

# 3. Outputs ready for openpilot deployment
ls output/
# → driving_policy.onnx           # ONNX model for openpilot
# → driving_policy_metadata.pkl   # Metadata for openpilot loader
# → policy_model.pth             # PyTorch checkpoint
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Policy Network (openpilot-compatible)
- **Backbone**: Layer-normalized GRU over vision feature history
- **Outputs**: 
  - `plan`: Trajectory MDN (5 mixtures × 33 timesteps × 15 dimensions)
  - `desired_curvature`: Steering MDN (single mode)
  - `desire_state`: Maneuver classification (8 classes)
- **Interface**: Exact match to openpilot's expected format

### Training System (no curriculum, full randomization)
- **Algorithm**: PPO with recurrent networks and GAE
- **Environment**: Kinematic simulation with heavy domain randomization
- **Reward**: Hard constraints + potential-based shaping + CVaR for tail safety
- **Vision**: Integration with real openpilot vision model or dummy features

## 📊 Key Features

### Openpilot Interface Contract
- **Inputs**: `features_buffer` (25×512), `desire` (25×8), `traffic_convention` (2), `lateral_control_params` (2), `prev_desired_curv` (25×1)
- **Outputs**: Plan trajectory, desired curvature, desire state (all as MDN parameters)
- **Runtime**: 20Hz operation, tinygrad compatible, FP16 safe

### Training Philosophy
- **No Curriculum**: Full domain randomization from episode 1
- **Hard Constraints**: Instant termination on safety violations
- **Risk Sensitivity**: CVaR-style objectives to eliminate tail risks  
- **Random From Start**: Following successful "random pipes" methodology

### Domain Randomization
- **Scenarios**: Lane roads, laneless two-way, intersections, chicanes
- **Physics**: Friction, mass, brake lag, sensor noise
- **Vision**: Brightness, latency, dropout simulation
- **Control**: Variable `lat_delay`, smoothing parameters

## 🎛️ Deployment

The trained model exports to openpilot-compatible format:

```bash
# After training, copy to openpilot
cp output/driving_policy.onnx /path/to/openpilot/models/
cp output/driving_policy_metadata.pkl /path/to/openpilot/models/

# Update openpilot model loader (modify selfdrive/modeld/modeld.py)
# Test with replay tools
cd /path/to/openpilot
./tools/replay/replay /path/to/route/segment
```

## 🧪 Validation

The system includes comprehensive validation:

1. **Code Structure**: Syntax and architectural validation
2. **Interface Compatibility**: MDN output format checking  
3. **Training Pipeline**: End-to-end execution validation
4. **ONNX Export**: Shape and metadata validation
5. **Deployment Ready**: Drop-in compatibility verification

## 🎯 Performance Targets

- **Lane Centering**: CTE < 0.5m (P95), heading error < 0.1 rad
- **Safety**: Zero boundary violations, zero turn cutting
- **Comfort**: Jerk RMS < 2.0 m/s³, smooth control commands
- **Latency**: 20Hz operation on comma three hardware

## 🔬 Research Foundation

Based on the successful "random pipes" approach:
- Heavy procedural randomization from start
- Potential-based reward shaping  
- Risk-sensitive objectives
- No staged difficulty or curriculum

Designed for the openpilot 2025+ architecture with separated vision/policy models and tinygrad runtime.
